# Low Power Assistant (LPA) middleware library

## Overview

The LPA middleware for Wi-Fi provides an easy way to make the low-power features available to developers in the form of a portable configuration layer. It provides features implementing low power functionality for MCUs, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth&reg;; however, the LPA library only needs to be included in applications that use low-power Wi-Fi operation.

The LPA middleware is essentially a Wi-Fi offload manager that is instantiated when Wi-Fi Connection Manager (WCM) initialization is done. The offload manager manages the configured offloads using a custom *design.modus* file created using the Device Configurator personality in PDL. The PDL personality consists of pin configurations for `CYBSP_WIFI_HOST_WAKE`, `CYBSP_WIFI_DEVICE_WAKE`, `CYBSP_BT_HOST_WAKE`, and `CYBSP_BT_DEVICE_WAKE`. The saved *design.modus* file generates the source files (*cycfg_connectivity_wifi.h* and *cycfg_connectivity_wifi.c*) which are compiled and linked in the executable for configured Wi-Fi offloads.

The LPA middleware library consists of the following components:

- Configurator tool (using a personality), which makes the low-power features of the system easy to use. This personality writes data structures; after the configuration is saved, it generates *cycfg_connectivity_wifi.c* and *cycfg_connectivity_wifi.h* files based on the settings made in the personality. See the [ModusToolbox&trade; Device Configurator tool guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Device_Configurator_4.10_User_Guide-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c88704c7a0188a18bc3c94e70&redirId=180683).

- The generated source files (*cycfg_connectivity_wifi.h*, *cycfg_connectivity_wifi*.c*) are compiled and linked in the executable. The API in the generated source will be invoked at system initialization.

The LPA configuration is applied from the host PSoC&trade; 6 MCU middleware to IoT wifi-bt firmware during the initialization such as follows are applied when a host WiFi connection is established with the Wi-Fi AP:
   - Bluetooth&reg; low power
   - ARP offload (ARPOL)

   The following features are applied when a TCP connection is established with a remote TCP server:

   - Packet filter offload (PFOL)
   - TCP keepalive offload (TKOL) 

## Features

- MCU low power
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth&reg; low power
- Wi-Fi Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) offload
- Wi-Fi packet filter offload
- Wi-Fi TCP keepalive offload

## Limitations

See the [Low Power Assistant Middleware Library Limitations](https://infineon.github.io/lpa/lpa_api_reference_manual/html/index.html).

## Dependent libraries

- [wifi-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls](https://github.com/Infineon/wifi-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls): To use the LPA library, the application should pull the wifi-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls library which will internally pull wifi-connection-manager, FreeRTOS, lwIP, mbed TLS, and other dependent modules.

## Quick start

The LPA could be configured using the ModusToolbox&trade; MCU, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth&reg; personalities. See the [Low Power Assistant middleware library configuration considerations](https://infineon.github.io/lpa/lpa_api_reference_manual/html/index.html).


### FreeRTOS

See [wifi-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls README](https://github.com/Infineon/wifi-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls/blob/master/README.md#quick-start) Quick start section for basic Makefile changes required .

MCU Deep Sleep Functionality is enabled by default in *FreeRTOSConfig.h* as follows: 

```
#include <cycfg_system.h>
#if (CY_CFG_PWR_SYS_IDLE_MODE == CY_CFG_PWR_MODE_SLEEP) || (CY_CFG_PWR_SYS_IDLE_MODE == CY_CFG_PWR_MODE_DEEPSLEEP)
extern void vApplicationSleep( uint32_t xExpectedIdleTime );
#define portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP( xIdleTime ) vApplicationSleep( xIdleTime )
#define configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE  2
#endif

/* Deep Sleep Latency Configuration */
#if CY_CFG_PWR_DEEPSLEEP_LATENCY > 0
#define configEXPECTED_IDLE_TIME_BEFORE_SLEEP   CY_CFG_PWR_DEEPSLEEP_LATENCY
#endif
```

## Debugging

For Debugging, the application may enable debug, log, and error log messages by updating `ol_log_level[]` with `LOG_OLA_LVL_DEBUG`.

```
ol_log_level[LOG_OLA_OLM] = LOG_OLA_LVL_DEBUG;
ol_log_level[LOG_OLA_ARP] = LOG_OLA_LVL_DEBUG;
ol_log_level[LOG_OLA_PF]  = LOG_OLA_LVL_DEBUG;
ol_log_level[LOG_OLA_TKO] = LOG_OLA_LVL_DEBUG;
```
